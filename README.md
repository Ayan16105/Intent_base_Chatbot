# Intent-Based Chatbot Using NLP

![Chatbot Image](Images/Chatbot.png)

## Project Overview

This project implements an **Intent-Based Chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user inputs in a natural way by detecting intents and providing relevant responses. The interface is built using **Streamlit**, allowing real-time interaction with the chatbot. It uses a **Naive Bayes classifier** for intent detection and **TF-IDF vectorization** for converting text into numerical features.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Intent-Based Chatbots and their applications.
- Learn how to process user inputs using NLP techniques such as tokenization, intent detection, and entity recognition.
- Build a chatbot using Python and deploy it with Streamlit.
- Manage chat sessions dynamically using Streamlit's session state.
- Enhance user experience with a clean and interactive interface.
- Apply machine learning techniques such as **Naive Bayes** for intent classification and **TF-IDF vectorization** for text representation.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the chatbot and NLP logic.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for processing user inputs and detecting intents.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications, used to deploy the chatbot interface.
- **Naive Bayes**: A machine learning algorithm used for intent classification.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: A technique used for converting text into numerical features.
- **Session State (Streamlit)**: To maintain and manage chat history dynamically.
- **Cloud Platforms** (Future Deployment): Deployment on platforms like AWS or Heroku for public access.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Chatbot can handle dynamic, real-time conversations.
- **Intent Detection**: Detects predefined user intents and responds accordingly.
- **Session Management**: Stores chat history to provide a continuous interaction flow.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, clean, and responsive chatbot interface built with Streamlit.
- **Machine Learning-Powered**: Utilizes Naive Bayes for intent classification and TF-IDF for text vectorization.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans to integrate advanced NLP models (like BERT) and deploy the chatbot to cloud platforms.
